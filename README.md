My implementations of the covered algorithms in "Analysis of Algorithms" course in Spring 2020. Implementations are done using Java in an object oriented fashion. You can find the list of algorithms below, hopefully more algorithms will be added as we proceed in the semester. If you find a bug, feel free to open an issue.

### Current List of Algorithms
  #### Misc
   * Stable Marriage (Gale-Shapley Algorithm)

  #### Undirected Unweighted Graphs
  * BFS
  * DFS
  * Finding distance between two nodes
  * Checking if a path exists between two nodes
  * Finding connected components
  * Bipartiteness check
  #### Directed Weighted Graphs
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
  * Prim's Algorithm
